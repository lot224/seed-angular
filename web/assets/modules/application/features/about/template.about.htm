  Getting down to it, this project was created out of pure laziness.
  I was tired of digging through other projects of mine to find the latest scaffolding code that I was happy with to help stub out a new website.
  So now by maintaining this project and keeping it fresh, I can clone it into a new repo and start working on a site rather than spend time setting up the foundation of the app.

  So moving forward, whenever I start working on a seed clone.
  If I feel that there is something I added that the seed project could benefit from, it will only take a few moments to update the project and check it in.
  Now the next time I clone it, no need to hunt down that service/directive.
